##  Overview

This project is a simple, interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns placing their symbols ("O" and "X") on a 3x3 grid, aiming to create a straight line horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The project demonstrates essential front-end development skills, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic game logic implementation.

##  Features

1.Interactive Gameplay:
Players take turns clicking on the grid to place their symbol ("O" or "X").
The game automatically disables a box once a symbol is placed to prevent overwriting.

2.Win Detection:
The game checks for winning combinations after each move using predefined patterns.
If a player achieves a winning combination, the game announces the winner.

3.Draw Detection:
If all boxes are filled without any player winning, the game declares a draw.

4.Visual Feedback:
Different colors are used for "O" and "X" to easily distinguish between the two players (e.g., "O" in green and "X" in red).
A message container displays the winner or announces a draw.

5.Game Reset and New Game:
Players can reset the current game or start a new game at any time, clearing the board and resetting the turn.
The game state (turn, filled boxes) is reset, allowing for a fresh start.

6.User-Friendly Interface:
The game features a simple and clean interface with clear indications of the current game state.
Buttons for resetting and starting a new game are provided for easy interaction.
